For my Phase 2 project I created an art portfolio using create-react-app and a db.json I compiled
listing out drawings, an id, and a path to the image stored in the Public Folder within the Assets 
subfolder. 

The routing uses React Router version 6. 

This project runs on http://localhost:3001, and the db.json runs on http://localhost: 3000.

The page included five routes that let a navigate to:
Home 
About
Drawings
Photos
Contact

The content in each is minimal, but serves as a template for an online portfolio.

The Components for this project are
Home 
About
Drawings
ArtCard
ArtList
Photos
Contact


App.js is in the src folder, it contains the routes and the NavBar.

I detailed the use of each component with comments within each componenet, but an overview is that 
the data is pulled in with a GET request in the Drawings component, which is the container for all of 
the drawings. The data is mapped out in the ArtList component and displayed in the ArtCard Component.
The ArtCard componenet imports an index.css file for styling elements.
The Contact form contains an artists contact information, as well as a form for a user to submit
a request for a commission. This form uses POST to add the data to a nested data list on the db.json called "contact." When the user successfully sends a comment a message appears to let them know they've successfully submitted their requuest.
